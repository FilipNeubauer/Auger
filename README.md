# Auger Data Analysis

This is a repository with few of my programs for analysing open data from Pierre Auger Observatory. I make these programs for my student scientific internship on [Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences](https://www.fzu.cz/en/home).

You can find all of the datasets [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/augeropendata/release-2021-v1)
